REQUIREMENTS:
Python,
nltk.
speech_recognition.

RUNNING THE CODE:
Ensure Python and the specified libraries are installed with the appropriate versions.
Run the sentiment_analysis.py file using Python.

USAGE:
The code captures audio from the microphone and converts it to text for sentiment analysis.
Spoken text is analyzed and categorized as positive, negative, or neutral based on sentiment scores.
The sentiment analysis results are displayed, indicating the spoken text and its sentiment along with corresponding sentiment scores.

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
Ensure a functional microphone to enable audio input for sentiment analysis.
Modifications or extensions can be made to the code for handling different languages or customizing sentiment categorization thresholds.
